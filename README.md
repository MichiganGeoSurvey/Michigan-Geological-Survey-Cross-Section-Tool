# Michigan Geological Survey: Cross-Section Tool Box
 The following tool was created to automate the process of creating project files for groundwater analysis, as well as provide a resource for establishing cross-sectional views of geologic data. The implementation of the tools is as follows:
1. Create an analysis-ready project with all necessary datasets within Michigan (Not applicable for other states).
2. Create analysis-ready water well datasets with complete data transformation and formatting to the standards set by the Michigan Geological Survey.
3. Generate groundwater surface profiles based on the needs of the project.
4. Generate full cross-section views of multiple lines utilizing:
   1. Borehole depths and lithologies.
   2. Screened intervals.
   3. Surface topography profiles.
   4. Bedrock topography profiles.
   5. Groundwater topography profiles.
   6. Gridded box profile.
5. Generate segments of the full cross-section tool as data is changed.

**IMPORTANT NOTES**

The processing time of all of the tools is directly related to the size of the project & size/number of cross-sections. Large scale projects with many cross-sections can take hours or even days to complete. This time will hopefully be reduced in the future through code optimizations and updates.
